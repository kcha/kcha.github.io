# About

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Molecular Genetics at the
University of Toronto (co-supervised by [Ben
Blencowe](http://sites.utoronto.ca/intron) and [Quaid
Morris](http://www.morrislab.ca)). My research is focused on developing
computational and machine learning methods to study the transcriptome of the cell using high-throughput sequencing data.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a research intern with the
Microsoft Biology Initiative group at
[Microsoft Research](https://research.microsoft.com) where I
developed [bioinformatics software](https://seqcos.codeplex.com/) using
.NET.
