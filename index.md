# About

I completed my PhD in the Department of Molecular Genetics at the
University of Toronto (co-supervised by [Ben
Blencowe](http://sites.utoronto.ca/intron) and [Quaid
Morris](http://www.morrislab.ca)). My research was focused on developing
computational and machine learning methods to study the transcriptome of the
cell using high-throughput sequencing data.

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a research intern with the
Microsoft Biology Initiative group at
Microsoft Research.
