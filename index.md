# About

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Molecular Genetics at the University
of Toronto and co-supervised by [Ben
Blencowe](http://sites.utoronto.ca/intron) and [Quaid
Morris](http://www.morrislab.ca). My research is focused on using computational and machine learning methods to study post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, particularly alternative splicing and 3' end processing, from high-throughput data.

Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a research intern with the
Microsoft Biology Initiative group at
[Microsoft Research](https://research.microsoft.com), Redmond, WA, where I developed [bioinformatics software](https://seqcos.codeplex.com/) using
.NET.
