# About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Molecular Genetics at the University
of Toronto. I am co-supervised by [Ben
Blencowe](http://sites.utoronto.ca/intron) and [Quaid
Morris](http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/homepage.html). 

I received a M.Sc. in Human Genetics and Bioinformatics at McGill University and
a B.Sc. in Bioinformatics at the University of Waterloo. My M.Sc. thesis focused
on computationally characterizing alternative splicing and gene fusions using
microarray and high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies, respectively. 

After my M.Sc. and prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a research intern at
Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA, where I developed bioinformatics software as
part of the [Microsoft Biology Initiative](http://research.microsoft.com/en-
US/projects/bio/default.aspx).

Outside of the lab, you'll most likely find me in cleats chasing [flying discs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_%28sport%29).
