# About

I am currently Head of Data Science, Genomics at
[BioSymetrics](https://www.biosymetrics.com).

I completed my PhD in the Department of Molecular Genetics at the
University of Toronto (co-supervised by [Ben
Blencowe](http://sites.utoronto.ca/intron) and [Quaid
Morris](http://www.morrislab.ca)). My research was focused on developing
computational and machine learning methods to study the
[transcriptome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcriptome) using
high-throughput sequencing datasets. Some of my PhD projects can be found in
[here](projects).

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a research intern with the
Microsoft Biology Initiative group at
Microsoft Research.
