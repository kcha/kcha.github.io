# Bioinformatics

## Python packages
 - [rnascan](https://github.com/morrislab/rnascan): Tool for
simultaneous scanning of RNA sequences and secondary structures with sequence
and secondary structure position frequency matrices.

## R packages
 - [psiplot](https://github.com/kcha/psiplot): For plotting PSI
values of alternatively spliced events computed by [VAST-
TOOLS](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools).

## Shiny apps
 - [psiplotter](https://github.com/kcha/psiplotter-app): A companion app for viewing PSI
plots computed by [VAST-TOOLS](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools).
([Demo](https://kcha.shinyapps.io/psiplotter-app))


## .NET
 - [SeQCoS](https://seqcos.codeplex.com/): a .NET high-throughput
sequencing quality control tool written in C#. This project was developed during
my internship at Microsoft Research.

## Web
 - [ElastoDB](http://www.compsysbio.org/elastin/): a sequence database and
website for the gene [elastin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin). This was
one of my first bioinformatics project as an undergraduate co-op student in the
[Parkinson Lab](http://www.compsysbio.org/front/). I updated the design and
functionality of the website using PHP and enhanced the PostgreSQL database
working behind it. (See [He et al.,
2007](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0945053X07000789) for
more details)

# Miscellaneous

## Shiny apps
 - [Colour Bar Builder](https://github.com/kcha/colour_bar_builder): A simple
app for creating custom colour bars.
([Demo](https://kcha.shinyapps.io/colour_bar_builder))
 - [Bike Share Toronto Ride Report](https://github.com/kcha/bike_share_ride_report): A
Shiny app that analyzes ride data from your [Bike Share
Toronto](https://www.bikesharetoronto.com/) account and generates a report of
your ride usage. ([Demo](https://kcha.shinyapps.io/bike_share_ride_report))
