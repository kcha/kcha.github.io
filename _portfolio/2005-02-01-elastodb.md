A sequence database and
website for the gene [elastin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin). This was
one of my earliest bioinformatics projects as an undergraduate co-op student in the
[Parkinson Lab](http://www.compsysbio.org/front/). I updated the design and
functionality of the website using PHP and enhanced the back-end PostgreSQL database with new data tables.
